# Ticket-Shop

This is our Norouz project The Ticket-Shop.
It includes many API for creating, modifying, and updating users and also for tickets.
User can see the list of tickets and order as many as it wants.
User can increase and decrease it's wallet.
After those things I said, user can order a ticket. Ticket will change it's status as reserved, paid, or canceled.
finally user can print it's ticket or tickets.
